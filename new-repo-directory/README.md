# Welcome:

Thank you for taking the time to work on our coding/setup challenge.  
We would like you to convert the website.html into a ReactJS project/application.
Our suggestion is to spend a maximum 30-45 minutes on the task.

## Setup:

- Create a new ReactJS project (You are welcome to use create-react-app)
- You decide whether to choose JS, JSX or TSX
- Add Openlayers as a dependency to your solution https://openlayers.org

## Tasks:

- Make the website.html work the same, as in your ReactJS solution
- Commit your solution back to the received git repository
- Bundle your commited changes and send it back to us

## Bonus:

- Show multiple maps at the same time (Multiple instances of new ol.Map)
- Clean your code and remove all unused parts
